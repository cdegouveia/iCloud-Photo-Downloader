# iCloud-Photo-Downloader
This tool is designed to construct a local duplicate of a specified iCloud photo album. Upon generating the local copy, the tool systematically scans each image, compiling an inventory that includes any available GPS information. The resulting inventory, now populated with GPS coordinates, is stored in a local .csv file. This file can be parsed efficiently, offering an effective means to identify photos in close proximity to specified locations without the need to individually open each photo. Individually opening each file to interogate exif data through 50GB of photos can take several hours. Parsing the .csv file will significantly reduce the time needed. I use this tool to prepare an inventory that I then feed into an algorithm that seeks out photos taken near specified GPS coordinate. Typically the GPS coordinates are of project sites.
